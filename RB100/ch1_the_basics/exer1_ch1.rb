=begin
below is a wrong exercise, this is the proper one.

Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string.

=end

"bob" + " " + "smith"













=begin

Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

=end
#                       (method) 
#proper syntax is [array].each{|x| block   }
#                          (iterator)
#[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].each{|num| print num }

=begin
In the text book answer they define the array seperately by putting arr = [1..10] buts actually putting all the numbers in the middle.
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
like that.
